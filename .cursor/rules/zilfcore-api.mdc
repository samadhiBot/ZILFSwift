# ZILFCore API

## GameObjects

- Always use `init(name:description:location:flags:)` when creating `GameObject` instances. Use the variadic `flags` param when flags are present, and omit the param when no flags are provided.
- Always use dynamic member lookup when accessing dynamic state values.

## Command parsing

- Always use `init?(from:)` when finding a `Command` in the user's input.

## Flags

- Always use the correct `Flag`

# Game Implementations

- Game code should use the ZILFCore APIs directly, and avoid convenience methods that wrap API methods like `setFlag`.
- Games should be fully contained in a namespace, and should not define global helper functions.
