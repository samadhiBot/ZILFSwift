# ZILFCore API

## GameObjects

- Always use `init(name:description:location:flags:)` when creating `GameObject` instances. Use the variadic `flags` param when flags are present, and omit the param when no flags are provided.
- Always use dynamic member lookup when accessing dynamic state values.
- Always use `setFlags` when setting multiple object flags at the same time.

## Command parsing

- Always use `init?(from:)` when finding a `Command` in the user's input.

## Flags

- Always translate ZIL flags to the correct `Flag` case.

# Game Implementations

- Games are built on top of the ZILFCore library.
- Games always use the ZILFCore APIs directly, avoiding convenience methods that wrap API methods.
- Games must always fully contained in a single namespace.
